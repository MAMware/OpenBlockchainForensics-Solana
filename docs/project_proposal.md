# Project Proposal for OpenBlockchainForensics-Solana

## Project Title
OpenBlockchainForensics-Solana: An Open-Source Investigation into the $LIBRA Token on Solana

## Project Overview
This project aims to conduct a transparent, community-driven investigation into the $LIBRA token controversy on the Solana blockchain, focusing on tracing $87 million allegedly removed by insiders to centralized exchanges (CEXs). We leverage blockchain forensics techniques to provide evidence, promote accountability, and critically examine the narrative surrounding $LIBRA.

## Objectives

- **Trace Illicit Funds**: Identify and trace the $87 million from $LIBRA liquidity pools to CEX deposit addresses to confirm off-ramping strategies.
- **Analyze Transaction Timelines**: Assess the speed and methods of cashouts to understand if insiders acted before regulatory or community action could be taken.
- **Promote Transparency**: Open-source all methodologies, scripts, and findings to allow public scrutiny and reproducibility.
- **Engage the Community**: Involve affected users, X users, and blockchain enthusiasts in the investigation process, inviting contributions and feedback.
- **Collaborate with Universities**: Utilize academic resources for compute power, data analysis, and outreach to scale the investigation.

## Scope

The initial scope focuses on the $LIBRA token, but the project aims to establish a framework for future blockchain forensics investigations on Solana.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Use Solana's JSON-RPC API to retrieve transaction data related to $LIBRA liquidity pool activities.
2. **Tracing**: Develop scripts to trace USDC and SOL from insider wallets to CEX addresses, employing wallet clustering and transaction analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate transaction flows and timelines for public understanding.
4. **Transparency**: Open-source all code and intermediate data, ensuring anonymity and privacy compliance.

## Collaboration with Universities

- **Compute Resources**: HPC clusters or cloud credits to process large datasets.
- **Expertise**: Computer science, data science, and blockchain research departments to enhance scripts, analysis, and data integrity.
- **Outreach**: Promote the project within academic and local communities in Argentina to engage affected users and increase project visibility.

## Expected Outcomes

- Quantified evidence of $LIBRA token manipulation or fraud.
- A robust, open-source framework for blockchain forensics that can be adapted for future investigations.
- Increased public awareness and potential regulatory action on blockchain fraud.

## Project Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Setup, initial data collection, and prototype development (72 Hours)
- **Phase 2**: Full-scale tracing and analysis, community engagement (144 Hours)
- **Phase 3**: Data visualization, report compilation, and public dissemination
